<!-- Abstract -->
<div class="abstract-box">
    <h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
    <pre>
White dwarfs are the dense stellar remnants of Sun-like stars that have run out 
of nuclear fuel. Recent discoveries of exoplanets orbiting white dwarf stars have 
highlighted their potential to support habitable environments. This paper reviews 
current understanding of the formation, stability, and habitability of planets 
orbiting white dwarfs. We examine physical constraints affecting planetary survival, 
including stellar evolution impacts, habitable zone locations, and detection methods. 
While conditions are restrictive, emerging evidence suggests white dwarf systems 
are interesting targets in the search for extraterrestrial life.

<!-- Introduction -->
<h3 id="Introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p id="Introduction_InText" class="ex1">
<pre>
White dwarfs mark the final evolutionary stage of stars with initial masses of 
around 3-4M☉. Approximately 10 billion exist in the Milky Way (Space.com, 2024), 
with around 97% of stars in our galaxy eventually becoming white dwarfs. After 
exhausting their nuclear fuel, these stars shed their outer layers, leaving behind 
compact, electron degenerate cores. Without ongoing nuclear fusion, white dwarfs 
emit leftover thermal energy and ultimately become black dwarfs.

Some white dwarfs are surrounded by debris disks, which can form second generation 
planets, while others retain pre-existing exoplanets that survived the host star's 
evolution. These findings have raised growing interest in whether white dwarf 
systems can sustain conditions suitable for life.
</pre>
</p>

<!-- Formation -->
<h3 id="Formation">2. Planetary Formation & Survival</h3>
<p id="Formation_InText" class="ex1">
<pre>
When a parent star evolves into a red giant, it can engulf nearby planets within 
roughly 1 AU. However, some research indicates that planets orbiting within 
approximately 2 AU may survive this red giant stage. Their orbits can expand due 
to stellar mass loss, resulting in increased semimajor axes and longer orbital periods.

Certain second-generation white dwarf planets can form from a progenitor's debris 
disk. This can happen through tidal disruption where a companion star is pulled 
apart by the white dwarf's strong gravity, producing a disk of gas and dust. 
Additionally, gravitational interactions like Kozai-Lidov cycles can affect distant 
planets, drawing them closer to the white dwarf.
</pre>
</p>

<!-- Habitable Zones -->
<h3 id="Zones">3. Habitable Zones</h3>
<p id="Zones_InText" class="ex1">
<pre>
Due to their small radii and low luminosities, white dwarfs emit very little light. 
Consequently, their habitable zones are found extremely close to the star, typically 
around 0.012AU. As white dwarfs cool, their habitable zones migrate inward. 
Planets within the habitable zone are likely to become tidally locked.
</pre>

<!-- Challenges -->
<h3 id="Challenges">4. The Habitability Challenge</h3>
<p id="Challenges_InText" class="ex1">
<pre>
This continuous inward migration of the habitable zone creates a significant 
problem. Even if a planet is initially located within this zone, it will eventually 
move out as the star cools. However, recent research suggests that in some cases 
the cooling of white dwarfs slows down, which can temporarily heat the star and 
pause cooling for up to 10 billion years.

Newly formed white dwarfs can reach surface temperatures of over 100,000 K and 
emit strong ultraviolet and X-ray radiation, posing a serious threat to nearby 
planets. Therefore, planets must migrate into the habitable zone only after the 
white dwarf has cooled significantly.
</pre>
</p>

<!-- Detection -->
<h3 id="Detection">5. Detection & Characterisation</h3>
<p id="Detection_InText" class="ex1">
<pre>
Standard exoplanet detection methods have proven to be less effective for white 
dwarf systems due to their small radii and low luminosities. These characteristics 
make infrared excess detection more efficient. Using this approach, the first 
confirmed transiting white dwarf planet was discovered with JWST's instruments.

Direct imaging is another promising technique, benefitting from the white dwarf's 
low luminosity. This greatly increases the planet to white dwarf contrast ratio 
and improves detectability of orbiting planets.
</pre>
</p>

<!-- Discussion -->
<h3 id="Discussion">6. Discussion</h3>
<p id="Discussion_InText" class="ex1">
<pre>
The possibility that white dwarfs could host habitable planets challenges 
traditional beliefs about stellar life cycles. The significant physical and 
biological challenges make chances of habitability seem unlikely. However, the 
long lifespan of white dwarfs and the ability to detect close-in planets make 
these systems essential targets for astrobiology.
</pre>
</p>

<!-- Conclusions -->
<h3 id="Conclusions">7. Conclusions</h3>
<p id="Conclusions_InText" class="ex1">
<pre>
While prospects for life on planets around white dwarfs are uncertain, they are 
not negligible. Surviving or newly formed planets could maintain stable 
environments for billions of years under specific conditions. The discovery of 
transiting planets around white dwarfs indicates that such systems exist and merit 
attention in future observational campaigns.
