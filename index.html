        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <div id="Abstract_InText">
            <p>
            White dwarfs are the dense stellar remnants of Sun-like stars that have run out of nuclear fuel and leave behind a core mainly composed of carbon and oxygen. Most white dwarfs have a mass of about 0.6M☉ and a radius similar to that of Earth. Recent discoveries of exoplanets orbiting white dwarf stars highlight their potential to support a habitable environment and have sparked interest about whether these systems can maintain conditions that would be suitable for organisms to develop. In this work, we review current understandings of the formation, stability, and habitability of planets orbiting white dwarfs in order to evaluate their potential for life.

    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <section id="Introduction" class="ex1">
        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <div id="Introduction_InText">
            <p>
            White dwarfs mark the final evolutionary stage of stars with initial masses of around 3–4M☉. There are approximately 10 billion white dwarfs in the Milky Way, and around 97% of all stars in our galaxy will eventually become white dwarfs. After exhausting their nuclear fuel, these stars shed their outer layers and leave behind compact, electron-degenerate cores.
            </p>
            <p>
            Some white dwarfs are surrounded by debris disks, which can form second-generation planets, while others retain pre-existing exoplanets that survived the host star’s evolution. These findings have raised growing interest in whether white dwarf systems can sustain conditions suitable for life.

    <!-- FORMATION AND SURVIVAL -->
    <section id="FormationAndSurvival" class="ex1">
        <h3>2. Planetary Formation and Survival</h3>
        <div id="FormationAndSurvival_InText">
            <p>
            When a parent star evolves into a red giant, it can engulf nearby planets within roughly 1 AU, meaning most close-in planets are destroyed during this phase. However, some research indicates that planets orbiting within approximately 2 AU may survive, although their orbits can expand due to stellar mass loss.
            </p>
            <p>
            Certain second-generation white dwarf planets can form from a progenitor’s debris disk, such as WD 1856+534 b. Gravitational interactions like Kozai-Lidov cycles can draw distant planets closer to the white dwarf.

    <!-- HABITABLE ZONES -->
    <section id="HabitableZones" class="ex1">
        <h3>3. Habitable Zones around White Dwarfs</h3>
        <div id="HabitableZones_InText">
            <p>
            Due to their low luminosity, white dwarfs have habitable zones extremely close to the star—around 0.012 AU. As white dwarfs cool, these zones migrate inward.
            </p>
            <p>
            Planets in the habitable zone are likely to be tidally locked, but with a thick atmosphere or active oceans, heat could still be redistributed well enough for habitability.
            </p>

    <!-- HABITABILITY CHALLENGE -->
    <section id="HabitabilityChallenge" class="ex1">
        <h3>4. The Habitability Challenge</h3>
        <div id="HabitabilityChallenge_InText">
            <p>
            The inward migration of the habitable zone means that even if a planet starts within it, it may eventually move out as the star cools. Neon-22 distillation can release gravitational energy and temporarily slow cooling by up to 10 billion years.
            </p>
            <p>
            Newly formed white dwarfs emit intense UV and X-ray radiation which can strip planetary atmospheres, meaning planets must migrate inward only after sufficient cooling.

    <!-- DETECTION -->
    <section id="Detection" class="ex1">
        <h3>5. Detection and Characterisation Opportunities</h3>
        <div id="Detection_InText">
            <p>
            Standard detection methods struggle due to the small size and faintness of white dwarfs. Nonetheless, these properties create excellent contrast ratios that improve direct imaging possibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
            WD 1856+534 b was detected through infrared excess and transits, demonstrating that close-in white dwarf planets can in fact be observed.

        <h3>6. Discussion</h3>
        <div id="Discussion_InText">
            <p>
            White dwarf planets challenge traditional beliefs about post-main-sequence habitability. Although atmospheric loss, tidal locking and migration pose challenges, white dwarfs’ long lifespans make them compelling astrobiological targets.

        <div id="Conclusions_InText">
            <p>
            While prospects for life around white dwarfs are uncertain, they are not negligible. Planets that survive stellar evolution or form afterward may still maintain habitability for billions of years.
