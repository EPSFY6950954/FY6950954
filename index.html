            <p>
                White dwarfs are the dense stellar remnants of Sun-like stars that have 
                run out of nuclear fuel and leave behind a core mainly composed of 
                carbon and oxygen. Most white dwarfs have a mass of about 0.6M☉ and 
                a radius similar to that of Earth. Recent discoveries of exoplanets 
                orbiting white dwarf stars highlight their potential to support a 
                habitable environment and have sparked interest about whether these 
                systems can maintain conditions that would be suitable for organisms to 
                develop. In this work, we review current understandings of the 
                formation, stability, and habitability of planets orbiting white dwarfs 
                in order to evaluate the potential for life. We examine the physical 
                constraints affecting planetary survival, including the impact of 
                stellar evolution, the location and evolution of habitable zones as 
                white dwarfs cool and fade, and the biological and observational aspects 
                for detecting life. While conditions for habitability are restrictive, 
                emerging evidence suggests white dwarf systems are interesting targets 
                in the search for extraterrestrial life.

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <h3 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            White dwarfs mark the final evolutionary stage of stars with initial 
            masses of around 3-4M☉, which is not enough for them to become neutron 
            stars or black holes. There are approximately 10 billion white dwarfs 
            in the Milky Way and around 97% of all stars in our galaxy will 
            eventually become white dwarfs. After exhausting their nuclear fuel, 
            these stars shed their outer layers and leave behind compact, 
            electron-degenerate cores. Without ongoing nuclear fusion, white 
            dwarfs emit leftover thermal energy and gradually cool, ultimately 
            becoming black dwarfs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some white dwarfs are surrounded by debris disks, which can form 
            second-generation planets, while others retain pre-existing exoplanets 
            that survived the host star's evolution. These findings have raised 
            growing interest in whether white dwarf systems can sustain conditions 
            suitable for life. This paper explores both theoretical and 
            observational perspectives on the habitability of white dwarf systems.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Planetary Formation and Survival -->
        <h3 id="formation">2. Planetary Formation and Survival</h3>
        <p>
            When a parent star evolves into a red giant, it can engulf nearby 
            planets within roughly 1 AU, meaning most close-in planets are 
            destroyed during this phase. However, some research indicates that 
            planets orbiting within approximately 2 AU may survive this red giant 
            stage, although their orbits can expand due to stellar mass loss, 
            resulting in increased semimajor axes and longer orbital periods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Certain second-generation white dwarf planets can form from a 
            progenitor's debris disk, such as WD 1856+534 b. This happens through 
            tidal disruption, where a companion star is pulled apart by the white 
            dwarf's strong gravity, producing a disk of gas and dust. Additionally, 
            gravitational interactions like Kozai-Lidov cycles can affect distant 
            planets, drawing them closer to the white dwarf.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Habitable Zones around White Dwarfs -->
        <h3 id="habitable-zones">3. Habitable Zones around White Dwarfs</h3>
        <p>
            Due to their small radii and low luminosities, white dwarfs emit very 
            little light, with their only significant source of energy being 
            residual thermal radiation which decreases over time. Consequently, 
            their habitable zones, regions where liquid water could exist on a 
            planet's surface, are found extremely close to the star, typically 
            around 0.012AU.
        </p>
        <p>
            As white dwarfs cool, their habitable zones migrate inward, with the 
            rate of this migration depending on the star's age and temperature. 
            Planets within the habitable zone are likely to become tidally locked, 
            resulting in permanent day and night hemispheres. However, a 
            sufficiently dense atmosphere or active oceanic circulation could help 
            redistribute heat effectively and maintain moderate surface conditions 
            across the planet.
        </p>
        
        <!-- The Habitability Challenge -->
        <h3 id="habitability-challenge">4. The Habitability Challenge</h3>
        <p>
            The continuous inward migration of the habitable zone creates a 
            significant problem. Even if a planet is initially located within this 
            zone, it will eventually move out as the star cools, becoming too cold 
            to sustain life. However, recent research suggests that in some cases, 
            the cooling of white dwarfs slows down due to neon-22 distillation, 
            where heavier elements sink towards the core and release gravitational 
            energy. This can temporarily heat the star and pause cooling for up to 
            10 billion years, prolonging the stability of the habitable zone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Newly formed white dwarfs can reach surface temperatures of over 
            100,000 K and emit strong ultraviolet and X-ray radiation, posing a 
            serious threat to nearby planets, as such radiation can strip away 
            planetary atmospheres and evaporate surface water. For this reason, 
            planets must migrate into the habitable zone only after the white dwarf 
            has cooled significantly. Planets with large enough water reserves and 
            orbits which are slightly beyond the typical habitable zone may be more 
            likely to retain surface water.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Detection and Characterisation Opportunities -->
        <h3 id="detection">5. Detection and Characterisation Opportunities</h3>
        <p>
            Standard exoplanet detection methods, such as transit and radial 
            velocity techniques, have proven to be less effective for white dwarf 
            systems due to their small radii and low luminosities, with only 20% of 
            known planets orbiting white dwarfs being discovered using these 
            methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nonetheless, these characteristics can also offer unique advantages. 
            The featureless spectra of white dwarfs make infrared excess detection 
            more efficient. This approach enabled the discovery of the first 
            confirmed transiting white dwarf planet, WD 1856+534b with JWST's 
            Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) detecting its thermal emission and 
            confirming that it is close-orbiting, Jupiter-sized planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Direct imaging is another promising technique, benefitting from the 
            white dwarf's low luminosity, which is typically 10^2-10^5 x fainter 
            than main-sequence stars. This greatly increases the 
            planet-to-white-dwarf contrast ratio and improves the detectability of 
            orbiting planets.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Discussion -->
        <h3 id="discussion">6. Discussion</h3>
        <p>
            The possibility that white dwarfs could host habitable planets 
            challenges traditional beliefs about stellar life cycles and 
            post-main-sequence environments. With significant physical and 
            biological challenges, particularly regarding planetary migration, 
            tidal locking and atmospheric survival, the chances of habitability may 
            seem low. However, the long lifespan of white dwarfs and the ability to 
            detect close-in planets make these systems essential targets for 
            astrobiology. If life can emerge or adapt under such extreme and 
            persisting conditions, white dwarf systems might be able to harbour 
            life long after main-sequence stars have faded.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Conclusions -->
        <h3 id="conclusions">7. Conclusions</h3>
        <p>
            While prospects for life on planets around white dwarfs are uncertain, 
            they are not inconsiderable. Planets that survive the red giant phase or 
            form afterward could maintain stable, habitable environments for 
            billions of years under specific conditions. The discovery of transiting 
            planets around white dwarfs indicates that such systems exist and merit 
            attention in future observational campaigns, which may ultimately reveal 
            whether these remnants of stellar evolution can host living worlds.
